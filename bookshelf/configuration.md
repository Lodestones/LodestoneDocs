### [ðŸ¡¸ Back to Using Lead](lead/usage.md)
<br>

# Configuring Lead
> Warning: Before configuring Lead, it is recommended that you learn what [YAML](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/yaml_introduction.htm) is. It is a data serialization language. Meaning that one invalid syntax will result in the plugin to fail.

# Reloading Configuration
You are able to update Lead's configurations without a server restart!
Use `/team reload` to reload all configuration variables.
> Hint: To reload teams without a restart (usually to import backups), you can add the `-t` flag after.

## config.yml
This is the default configuration of Lead as of `v1.1.4`.
> Note: If you wish to change command's publicity, change the value from `null` to `lodestone.lead.commands.[name]`. You can use [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net) for a permission overhaul.
